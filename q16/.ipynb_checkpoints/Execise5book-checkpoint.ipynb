    "Guessing what Draw does : It calls itself when running the program. It goes forward a length, and repeats a series of turns over and over until n == 0. Every time it runs through the function, it will lower n by one until it returns back out. So, it goes forward, then left turn, then calls itself again. It goes forward and left until n decrements to 0. Then, it pops out to the original draw call and makes a right turn, then calls itself again. It's a recursive function that draws a fractal, guessing by the accompanying figure."
