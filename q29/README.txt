For my program, I tried 100, 1000, and 10000 points. For 100 points, it seems
as though I did not have enough points generated to get a real idea of the
distribution. It almost matched the Salpeter IMF, but I cannot be sure.

Trying 1000 points, I am starting to see deviates appear near my 100 Solar 
Mass limit, but it's still not complete. 

Once I set my program for 10,000 points, you can clearly see a slope that
matches my overlayed Salpeter IMF power law.
