I didn't get my file to compile properly when using dvi, and I can't get the 
\label and \ref functions to work correctly. I made a makefile with the simple list
of commands to compile my file, if it didn't give me a large error.

The final file is q15.pdf, which I created using pdflatex q15. 

I included my ref.bib file in there as well, which only contains a reference
to the paper I summarized.
